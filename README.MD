This is my version of Rock Paper Scissors.

On this page, you will be able to select between 'rock,' 'paper,' and 'scissors' through multiple choice buttons. This game and page uses a combination of HTML, CSS, and JS. I wanted to make the game easy to use without the need for typed user input.

The main challenges for me were implementing the onclick event because I had never done it before. Once that was working, I just needed to work on the styling of the page and UI. This has definitely helped my understanding of how each aspect of the project interact with one another (particularly between HTML and JS).
